CuteCyclopsCult Lab03 Plan

* Use Comparable array
* In Driver:
Method to record time difference average
1. Record time at start and end of each method (linSearch, binSearchIter)
  a. Use System.currentTimeMillis(); to record current current time
2. Record time at end of each method in 
  a. time for method = end - start
  b. have the time differences as elements and average them out  
  c. compare times for each method (use method)
Method to compare time difference averages for each search 
 
Test Cases:
1. Random number of int elements in Comparable[] with sorted numbers in each
  a. Test Cases with 100million, 750k 
  b. The targets themselves represent the worst case scenario: the last element in the array
