CuteCyclopsCult Lab03 Plan

* Include OrderedArrayList Wrapper Class
* Make Wrapper class for BinSearch.java and LinSearch.java
1. Record time at start and end of each method (linSearch, binSearchIter, binSearchRec)
  a. Use System.currentTimeMillis(); to record current current time
2. Record time at end of each method
  a. time for method = end - start
  b. compare times for each method

* Make Driver file
Test Cases:
1. Random number of elements in int[] with random, unsorted numbers in each
  a. random number to generate n, which will be used with 10^n for randomness
