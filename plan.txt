* Include OrderedArrayList Wrapper Class
* In Driver:
Method to record time difference average
1. Record time at start and end of each method (linSearch, binSearchIter, binSearchRec)
  a. Use System.currentTimeMillis(); to record current current time
2. Record time at end of each method in 
  a. time for method = end - start
  b. make an ArrayList for each search method and have the time differences as elements and average them out  
  c. compare times for each method (use method)
Method to compare time difference averages for each search 
 
Test Cases:
1. Random number of elements in int[] with random, sorted numbers in each
  a. Test Cases with 2 bill, 251 mil, .75 mil,
