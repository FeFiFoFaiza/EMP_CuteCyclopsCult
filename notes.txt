 * Don't need to allocate heap space to run searches on arrays of larger size (200mill+), instead increase the number of trials to find a measureable difference between binSearch and linSearch
 * Running 100 trials is fine as it creates a measureable difference between binSearch and linSearch, so running 1000 is uneccesary and time consuming
 * Worst case scenario for this experiment is when target is the last element of an array, therefore the target element for the searchs should be the length of the array -1. (Or the target does not exist in array)
 * Cannot use the get method for Comparables, since it is a method for ArrayList

 * Running a test on arrays with more than 210 million elements causes an Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

 * To make large numbers readable, use underscores (eg. 1_000_000 is 1 million)

 * Must use System.currentTimeMillis(); to record times
